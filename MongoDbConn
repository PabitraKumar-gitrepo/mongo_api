mongodb library to be installed
python -m pip install "pymongo[srv]==3.11"

requirements.txt

python virtual environment
we need to create separate environment for each different process.
its like a separate folder.

create python virtual environment

run this command - python -m venv mytestenv

then activate this python virtual environment
take the activate path from virtual environment folder.

mytestenv -> Scripts -> activate  - mytestenv/Scripts/activate -- you may get security error bcoz powershell
blocks running scripts by default.

run this command in windows powershell as admin 
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

then again run activate in vs code terminal -mytestenv/Scripts/activate

all the libraries then to be installed here in my python virtual env folder


then install all the libraries from requirements.txt file. - its like bulk installation.

command - pip install -r requirements.txt (make sure that you are inside the folder where requirements.txt file exists)

or give full path as below

pip install -r C:\Users\YourName\project\requirements.txt
